# SnowHound

## Overview

The BloodHound extension for Snowflake provides a powerful way to visualize access control and potential attack paths within a Snowflake environment. By mapping key entities such as Users, Roles, Databases, Warehouses, and Integrations, along with the permissions that connect them, this extension enables security teams to gain a comprehensive understanding of their Snowflake landscape. The extension leverages Snowflakeâ€™s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, allowing organizations to identify and address attack paths in their Snowflake tenants. With this tool, users can explore how access is granted, track potential attack paths, and implement effective security strategies to mitigate risk in their Snowflake accounts.

## Collector Setup & Usage



## Schema

Below is the complete set of nodes and edges as defined in the [model](./model.json).

### Nodes
